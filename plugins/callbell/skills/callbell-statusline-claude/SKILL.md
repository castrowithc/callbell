  Set up the Claude Code statusline: a configurable bar with toggleable widgets — model, reasoning effort,
  directory, git branch and diff, token usage, cost, and rate-limit resets. Start it by typing
  /callbell-statusline-claude; pass "disable X" or "enable Y" to toggle widgets.

# /callbell-statusline-claude

Configure the bar at the bottom of Claude Code: model, thinking effort, directory, git branch and diff,
token usage, cost, and rate-limit resets. Which widgets show is chosen in `~/.callbell/statusline.json`; the
render script is delivered payload the user never edits.

## When
- On the user's direct request. Slash-only: pointing the host statusline at a script is never something to
  auto-fire.
- This configures **Claude Code's** statusline specifically — hence the `-claude` name.

## Set up
1. Run the setup script. It copies the renderer to `~/.callbell/statusline.js` (a stable path that survives
   plugin updates, because the statusLine command runs without the plugin context), writes a default widget
   config if none exists, and points `~/.claude/settings.json` at it with a 60s refresh (needed so the
   reset countdowns tick between events):
   - Bash: `node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/callbell-statusline-setup.js"`
   - PowerShell: `node "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/callbell-statusline-setup.js"`
2. Tell the user it appears at the next interaction. It replaces any previous statusline.
3. **Ask whether the layout looks right.** If widgets are cut off or the dynamic wrapping misbehaves on
   their terminal, switch to the fixed layout: set `"layout": "fixed"` in `~/.callbell/statusline.json`.

## Widgets
Entries in the `widgets` array of `~/.callbell/statusline.json`. Drop an entry to hide it, reorder to reorder.

`model` · `thinking` (reasoning effort) · `dir` · `branch` · `diff` (git `+/-` and `pushed | commit needed |
push needed`) · `out` (last response tokens) · `context` (input bar, labelled `In:`) · `cost` · `reset`
(5h window) · `weekly-reset` (7d window) · `method` (`Sub`/`API`).

- Git widgets (`branch`, `diff`) hide themselves outside a repo — so a plain folder or an Obsidian vault
  shows no git segment.
- `reset` and `weekly-reset` need a Pro/Max subscription and hide on API usage; `method` shows which is in
  effect, so an empty reset is legible.

## Toggling from an argument
If the user passed one ("disable out, weekly-reset", "enable method", "put cost first"), edit the `widgets`
array in `~/.callbell/statusline.json` and confirm. No need to re-run setup — the renderer reads the config
on every render.

## Layout
- `wrap` (default): widgets flow left to right and reflow onto more lines when the window is too narrow.
  Nothing is dropped.
- `fixed`: four fixed rows — Model/Thinking/Dir · Branch/Diff · Out/In/Cost · Method/Reset/Weekly Reset —
  each showing only its active widgets. Use when wrap misbehaves.

## Separator
The `separator` field sets the dimmed string drawn between widgets. Default `" │ "`. Set it to `" · "`,
`" | "`, or `"  "` (two spaces, no visible divider) in `~/.callbell/statusline.json`, or ask the skill to
change it. Re-running setup after a plugin update copies the latest renderer and **tops up new config
fields** (like `separator`) into an existing config, without touching the user's widget choices.

## Colours (fixed in the renderer)
Context bar: green · >35% yellow · >45% orange · >70% red, relative to the model's own window size. Diff
`+` green, `-` red-orange.
